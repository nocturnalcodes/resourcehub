                    Responsive design ensures that a website and its content can adapt to different screen sizes, devices, and orientations.
                    This is imperative to making a website accessible and usable whether a user is accessing it from a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.
                    Implementing responsive design helps keep websites fluid and improves overall user experience across devices.

                <li>Implement layout systems that keep content flexible, such as Flexbox and CSS Grid.</li>
                <li>Use image sizing that will scale based on the screen size.</li>
                <li>Use units such as %, em, and rem to ensure content is scalable.</li>
                <li>Create a hamburger menu or collapsible elements for navigation.</li>
                <li>Ensure the navigation menu adjusts appropriately based on screen size.</li>

            <h2>Insights Gained in the Class</h2>
            <p>
                From this class, I gained insights into using Flexbox and CSS Grid to build flexible design layouts.
                I also learned how changing the units of measurement for sizing content can make the layout more fluid and adaptable.
                Another concept I learned and will implement in future projects is breakpoints. Breakpoints are used to exercise media queries which can apply specific styles to different screen widths.
                Breakpoints help the developer define at what pooint the website layout will change. This simulates the interface displayed on a desktop, then a laptop, then a mobile device. 
                I was able to experiment with past projects and observe how setting different breakpoints optimized layouts for various screen sizes.
