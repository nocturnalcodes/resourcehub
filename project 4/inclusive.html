                <p>
                    Inclusive Design involves creating websites and digital experiences that consider all users, regardless of ability, background, language, or device. 
                    Accessibility is an important part of this, addressing users with disabilities, but inclusive design expands to accommodate many more user needs, including cultural, linguistic, and technological diversity.
                    Implementing inclusive design ensures that websites are usable for older adults, people with temporary impairments, and users accessing content in different contexts such as mobile or low-bandwidth environments.

            <h2>Insights Gained in the Class</h2>
            <p>
                During this class, I learned that many websites could be improved with more inclusive practices. 
                Inclusive design enhances usability for a wider audience and positively impacts user engagement, 
                especially on e-commerce platforms. Developers can also follow the WCAG to ensure the design of 
                the website is inclusive to all user groups.
                Moreover, identifying pain points that users may experience based on the design of the website
                assists the designer in making a website that is inclusive.
                I also gained a deeper appreciation for designing with a diverse audience in mind and learned how 
                different assistive technologies support users with disabilities.
