                <p>
                    Website optimization is the act of improving how quickly a site loads and how efficiently it performs.
                    If done correctly, website optimization enhances user experience, accessibility, and search engine ranking.
                    A higher search engine ranking equates to more clicks and traffic to the website.
                    Optimizing a website also reduces server load and ensures smoother interactions for users across all devices.

            <p>
                I gained a better understanding of what performance metrics are and how they directly affect the efficiency and speed of a website. 
                Usability and search engine optimization is imperative to making your website easily discoverable my analyzing its keywords and technical elements.
                I also now realize that even modern websites can have performance issues. Moreover, running a website, whether it is one you developed or not, 
                through an optimization tool is extremely important, teaching principles that can be applied to future evaluations and iterations of your own projects.
                I now understand that performance can be affected by multiple factors including code, images, styles, and scripts, which reinforces the idea that website performance is a fluid situation throughout the development process.
