                <p>
                    User experience (UX) design focuses on how users experience and interact with
                    elements on a website or application. It encompasses understanding user needs, behaviors, and tasks,
                    then applying the necessary design principles to create interfaces that address user needs and are enjoyable to use.
                    UX design also emphasizes consistency, efficiency, and accessibility to ensure all users can complete their tasks effectively.

            <h2>Insights Gained in the Class</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout this course and through projects, I learned the importance of carefully planning each step of user research. 
                Completing heuristic evaluations are also important to evaluate the usability of the website based on principles such as error prevention and user control.
                Skipping the initial research and planning phases, such as wireframing and prototyping, can make creating a cohesive and effective interface much harder. 
                Gathering research from real users to identify pain points and creating personas is crucial, as it allows the designer to view the interface from the user's perspective. 
                This class helped me understand that real-world feedback is incredibly valuable. Designing for the user, not for oneself, is key to creating usable and enjoyable digital experiences.
